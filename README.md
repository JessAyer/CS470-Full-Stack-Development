# CS470-Full-Stack-Development

This course taught me how to containerize a full stack MEAN application with Docker and how to migrate that application to AWS S3 with Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and IAM. 
Included documents in this application are a powerpoint presentation on the tool and process I used as well as a final refelction on the course.
